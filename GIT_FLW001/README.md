GitFlow - 001

Based on 'Git Flow Part 1 - What is Git Flow?' at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LhTe8Mz6jM

#How it works

1) We have a ***central*** repository.
 
2) Developers work ***locally*** and push their branches.

3) Two branches used to record project history are ***Master*** and ***Develop***.

4) The ***Develop*** branch serves as an integration branch for ```features```.

5) The ***Master*** branch stores the official release history.
